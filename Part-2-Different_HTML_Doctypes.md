# Doctype
A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction which tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. The Doctype is not an element or tag, it lets the browser know about the version of or standard of HTML or any other markup language that is being used in the document.</br>
It declares at the top of webpage before all other elements.</br>
The DOCTYPE for HTML5 is case-insensitive and can be written as shown below:
```HTML
< !DOCTYPE html >
```
# Doctype Usage
The document type definition (DTD) is responsible for specifying the rules for the Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML) so that the browser processes the content correctly. But in the HTML version, HTML 5 there isnâ€™t any need of a reference to a document type definition (DTD) because HTML 5 is not based on a Standard Generalized Markup Language(SGML).
